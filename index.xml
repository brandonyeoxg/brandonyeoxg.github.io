Designed and implemented platform features for the subscriptions and fulfilment services in Grab that is used by over 2.5 million consumers daily.

While taking pride in maintaining code quality through SOLID principles on the code level and system design quality through using thought out patterns like event driven architecture using message queues.</description></item></channel></rss>
