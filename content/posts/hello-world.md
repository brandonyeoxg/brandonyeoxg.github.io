Hello world, I am starting my first step into posting on this webpage.
I'm hoping to share learnings on engineering ideas ranging from code to system design using this platform on a weekly basis.

I figured that posting like this would keep myself accountable for my own growth and internalise concepts better. I suppose another good side effect would be racking my brain to desseminate information in a logical and coherent way (it's been too long).

I hope my future posts will bring value to you and it will definitely be good fun to revisit as my future self.
