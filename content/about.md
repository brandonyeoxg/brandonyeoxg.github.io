Backend software engineer at Grab with over two years of experience building scalable distributed systems on the cloud.

Designed and implemented platform features for the subscriptions and fulfilment services in Grab that is used by over 2.5 million consumers daily.

What excites me is the challenge of working in large scale complex Service Oriented Architecuture (SOA) systems.
While taking pride in maintaining code quality through SOLID principles on the code level and system design quality through using thought out patterns like event driven architecture using message queues.


Aside from learning software engineering concepts and tools, I enjoy a cup of good latte too =).
